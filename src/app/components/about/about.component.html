    <span style="color:#116bb5;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2rem">Our River, Our Life</span> is dedicated to creating a citizen science platform for stream and river monitoring efforts, thus facilitating a voice for citizens by means of water quality testing, landscape monitoring and observations on flora and fauna, along with visual media documentation. The goal is to provide seamless data sharing, with geospatial data to give it perspective and focus, bringing waterways the much needed attention that is required.
    A wide array of approaches can be applied to stream and river monitoring, but more often various factors contributing to river health are intertwined with each other. This approach takes into consideration a broad spectrum of activities one can engage in, contributing to research and monitoring efforts, which can lead to location specific solutions which are more practical in nature. The philosophy and science of it emphasises on learning together, to better understand and respect the lifelines that support our very existence, through physical, chemical, biological and socio-ecological elements,  that make up our riverscapes.

      <p align="justify" class="about-description" >Streams and rivers are the arterial systems of our planet, allowing an abundance of life to flourish, creating unique ecosystems and supporting communities all along their pulsing flow. In India, the land of many rivers, we have the Himalayan rivers which get their ebb and flow, from glacier and snow melt during summer, further replenished by the Indian monsoon. Inland drainage systems, like the ones in Rajasthan which flow into the basin and are ephemeral. Rivers in peninsular India, flow to the cue of the monsoon rains, with the west flowing rivers and east flowing rivers, both perennial and seasonal depending on the area of the catchment and the number of tributaries. Needless to say, life thrives along our rivers, spanning political and cultural boundaries; while neighbours separated by district, state or national borders may not live under the same legal and cultural guidelines, communities can be citizens of the same watershed. By this understanding, ensuring the
        health of streams and rivers can be, as much a responsibility of citizens as it is to a government regulating agency.</p>

          Yes, we can. A very simple way to begin the exploration is to ask “How healthy is the water
          near us”? No matter where we live on the planet, our quality of life is directly dependent on
          the availability of freshwater and the health of our waterways. With the right tools and
          information combined with local or traditional knowledge, it is possible to tap into the
          potential of a community driven, grassroots orientated approach towards river monitoring
          and conservation. In other words, a citizen centric movement can go a long way in making
          a positive impact on the health of our rivers.</p>

          <p align="justify" class="about-description">Indigenous knowledge, such as the availability of fish species, for instance, and how to
            catch them, has instant power in connecting people to what they value about river
            resources. The sightings of otters, crocodiles, seasonal and migratory bird species can also
            tell us how healthy the river ecosystem is, indicating good health. <br/>  <br/>

            Delving deeper into the process, monitoring water quality can help identify sources of pollution and additionally aid with creating a network of individuals and groups keeping track of waterways at regular intervals, along its course. This broadens the scope of public involvement, providing a democratic platform to showcase concerns and meet challenges, which are otherwise difficult to address at a river basin scale.</p>
